                  What Are the Best Vapes for Nicotine Salt?
                </h2>

                  For several years now, nicotine salt e-liquid is been one of
                  the biggest success stories in the vaping industry. It’s
                  enabled people to have more satisfying experiences with
                  smaller vaping devices – and the fact that you can now have a
                  great vaping experience without using a full-sized vape mod
                  has encouraged more people than ever to finally make the
                  switch from smoking to vaping.

                Before you get too deep into troubleshooting your vape mod’s The
                term “nicotine salt” refers to the type of nicotine used in a
                bottle of e-liquid. Until fairly recently, all e-liquid – and
                almost all nicotine replacement products – used a different type
                of nicotine called freebase nicotine. Nicotine is salt in its
                natural form, but it’s converted to a free base during the
                process of extracting it from tobacco leaves. Ammonia is used as
                a solvent to increase the yield of the extraction, and ammonia
                is also responsible for the conversion of nicotine from a salt
                to a free base.

                The most important thing to know about shopping for a vaping
                device for nicotine salt vape juice is that the best salt nic
                vapes are always smaller devices. That’s because nicotine salt
                e-liquid usually comes in much higher nicotine strengths than
                freebase e-liquid.
