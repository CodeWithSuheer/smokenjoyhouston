                  Can You Bring a Vape on a Plane? How to Travel with Your Vape
                  in 2024

                  If you’ve completed your transition to vaping and are no
                  longer a smoker, there’s a good chance that your need for
                  nicotine isn’t as great as it once was. You probably find that
                  you can go longer without vaping than you previously were able
                  to go without smoking a cigarette. It’s likely, however, that
                  you still don’t want to be far from your vape if you’re going
                  to be out of the house for a while – and that definitely
                  applies to traveling with your vape. It’s not so different
                  from wanting to bring your cigarettes on the plane if you were
                  flying to another country.

                So, can you take a vape on a plane in 2024? In most cases,
                you’ll have no trouble traveling with your vape as long as you
                obey the rules that cover traveling with liquids and batteries

                Vaping regulations are continually evolving. Research the
                relevant laws about bringing vapes on a plane before you
                travel.The most important thing to know about bringing your vape
                on a plane is that airlines’ rules about vaping – and the vaping
                laws in the various nations around the world – can change
                without notice.

                Vaping devices and replacement batteries always belong in your
                carry-on bag. Don’t ever bring a vape on a plane in your checked
                luggage unless the battery is removed and stored separately in
                your hand baggage.
